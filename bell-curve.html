	  <h4>Epigraph</h4>

	  <blockquote>
	    [...] a fair Discussion of popular Prejudices [...] [whose] Discovery
might be productive of the most dangerous Consequences [...] all
Happiness [is] connected with the Practice of Virtue, which
necessarily depends upon the Knowledge of Truth.<br/ >

	    -- <strong>Edmund Burke, "A Vindication of Natural Society"</strong>

	<h4>Preface</h4>
	<blockquote>
	  This book is about differences in intellectual capacity
among people and groups and what those differences mean for America's
future.<br/ >
	    <strong>p. xxi (first sentence)</strong>

      <blockquote>
In one segment [of the population], life gets better [...]. In the
other group, life gets worse. [...] The mass of the nation belongs to
neither group, but their lives are increasingly shaped by the power of
the fortunate few and the plight of the despairing few.<br/ >
	  <strong>pp. xxi-xxii</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
To try to come to grips with the nation's problems without
understanding the role of intelligence is [...] to grope with symptoms
instead of causes<br/ >
	  <strong>pp. xxii-xxiii</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	We are not indifferent to the ways in which this book,
wrongly construed, might do harm.<br/ >
	    <strong>p. xxiii</strong>
	</blockquote>


      <blockquote>
	What good can come of understanding the relationship of
	intelligence to social structure and public policy? Little good can
	come without it.
