	<h4>Chapter 1 - Turtles all the way down</h4>
	<hr />

      </div>
      <blockquote>
	Here is the point of this book: While it may seem ridiculous
	and non-sensical to explain something by resorting to an
	infinity of turtles all the way down, <strong>it actually is
	much more ridiculous and non-sensical to believe that
	somewhere down there, there's a turtle floating in the
	air.</strong>  [...] when you behave in a particular way [...]
	it is because of the determinism that came just before, which
	was caused by the determinism just before that, and before
	that, all the way down. The approach of this book is to show
	how that determinism works, to explore how the biology over
	which you had no control, interacting with environment over
	which you had no control, made you you. <br />
	<strong>pp. 2-3</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	We are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and
	environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has
	brought us to any moment.<br />
	<strong>p. 4</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	there is no free will. This is what I have concluded, for a
	long, long time. And even I think that taking that seriously
	sounds absolutely nutty.<br />
	<strong>p. 6</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	no single result or discipline can [disprove free will]. But
	[...] <strong>put all the scientific results together, from
	all the relevant scientific disciplines</strong>, and
	there's no room for free will. [...]  Crucially, all these
	disciplines collectively negate free will because they are all
	interlinked, constituting the same ultimate body of
	knowledge. [...] There is not a single crack of daylight to
	shoehorn in free will. [...] The first half of the book's
	point is to rely on this biological framework in rejecting
	free will. [...] even I think it's crazy to take seriously all
	the implications of there being no free will. And despite
	that, the goal of the second half of the book is to do
	precisely that, both individually and societally. [...] The
	book's intentionally ambiguous title reflects these two halves
	[...]  <br />
	<strong>pp. 8-9</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	[the attitudes held by people writing about free will]
	come in four basic flavors:<br />
	<strong>The world is deterministic and there's no free
	will.</strong> I am coming from this perspective of "hard
	incompatibilism."<br />
	<strong>The world is deterministic and there is free
	will.</strong> [...] the book will most often be taking on
	these "compatibilists."<br />
	<strong>The world is not deterministic; there's no free
	will.</strong> [...] everything important in the world runs on
	randomness<br />
	<strong>The world is not deterministic; there is free
	will.</strong> [...] these "libertarian incompatibilists" are
	a rarity
	<br />
	<strong>pp. 10-11</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	There's a related quartet of views concerning the relationship
	between free will and moral responsibility. [...] [the latter]
	calls forth the concept of <strong>basic desert</strong>,
	where someone can <strong>deserve</strong> to be treated in a
	particular way. [...] these views are:<br/ >
	<strong>There's no free will, and thus holding people morally
	  responsible for their actions is wrong.</strong> Where I sit.
	<br />
	<strong>There's no free will, but it is okay to hold people
	  morally responsible for their actions.</strong> This is
	  another type of compatibilism&mdash;an absence of free
	  will and moral responsibility coexist without invoking the
	  supernatural.
	<br />
	<strong>There is free will, and people should be held
	  responsible.</strong> This is probably the most common
	  stance out there.
	<br />
	<strong>There is free will, but moral responsibility isn't
	  justified.</strong> This is a minority view.
	<br />
	<strong>pp. 11-12</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	my goal isn't to convince you that there is no free will; it
	will suffice if you merely conclude that there's so much less
	free will than you thought that you have to change your
	thinking about some truly important things.  <br />
	<strong>p. 12</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	If a compatibilist has not wrestled through being challenged by
	knowledge of the biology of who we are, it's not worth the
	time trying to counter their free-will belief. <br />
	<strong>p. 14</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	What do I mean by free will? [...] Show me a neuron being a
	causeless cause [of a behavior such as a man pulling the
	trigger of a gun]<br />
	<strong>pp. 14-15</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	What do I mean by determinism?  [...] start this topic with
	[...] "Laplace's demon". [...] Contemporary views of
	determinism have to incorporate<br /> 

	[1.] the fact that certain types of predictability turn out to
	be impossible [e.g., due to quantum indeterminacy] [...]<br />

	[2.] the role played by meta-level consciousness [e.g.,
	winding up as an adult exactly like one of your parents or
	their exact opposite] [...]<br />

	[3.] [the the fact that,] despite the world being
	deterministic, things can change.<br />

	[...] Imagine a university graduation ceremony. [...] Randomly
	pick any of the graduates. [...] notice [...] the person who
	is part of the grounds crew, collecting the garbage from the
	cans on the perimeter of the event. [...] Trade every factor
	over which they had no control [e.g., genes , womb,
	childhood], and you will switch who would be in the graduation
	robe and who would be hauling garbage cans. This is what I
	mean by determinism.<br />
