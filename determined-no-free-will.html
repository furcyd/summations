	<h4>Chapter 1 - Turtles all the way down</h4>

      <blockquote>
	Here is the point of this book: While it may seem ridiculous
	and non-sensical to explain something by resorting to an
	infinity of turtles all the way down, <strong>it actually is
	much more ridiculous and non-sensical to believe that
	somewhere down there, there's a turtle floating in the
	air.</strong>  [...] when you behave in a particular way [...]
	it is because of the determinism that came just before, which
	was caused by the determinism just before that, and before
	that, all the way down. The approach of this book is to show
	how that determinism works, to explore how the biology over
	which you had no control, interacting with environment over
	which you had no control, made you you. <br />
	<strong>pp. 2-3</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	We are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and
	environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has
	brought us to any moment.<br />
	<strong>p. 4</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	there is no free will. This is what I have concluded, for a
	long, long time. And even I think that taking that seriously
	sounds absolutely nutty.<br />
	<strong>p. 6</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	no single result or discipline can [disprove free will]. But
	[...] <underline>put all the scientific results together, from
	all the relevant scientific disciplines</underline>, and
	there's no room for free will. [...]  Crucially, all these
	disciplines collectively negate free will because they are all
	interlinked, constituting the same ultimate body of
	knowledge. [...] There is not a single crack of daylight to
	shoehorn in free will. [...] The first half of the book's
	point is to rely on this biological framework in rejecting
	free will. [...] even I think it's crazy to take seriously all
	the implications of there being no free will. And despite
	that, the goal of the second half of the book is to do
	precisely that, both individually and societally. [...] The
	book's intentionally ambiguous title reflects these two halves
	[...]  <br />
