	<h4>Preface</h4>
	<hr />
	
	<blockquote>
	  Language is beginning to submit to that uniquely satisfying
	  kind of understanding that we call science, but the news has
	  been kept a secret.<br/ >
	    <strong>p. xiii (third sentence)</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  I hope to convey the grand intellectual excitement that
	  launched the modern study of language several decades
	  ago. <br/ >
	    <strong>p. xiv</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  I can write in only one way, with a passion for powerful,
	  explanatory ideas, and a torrent of relevant detail.
	  
	  <br/ >
	    <strong>p. xiv</strong>

	<h4>Chapter 1 - An Instinct to Acquire an Art</h4>
	<hr />
	
	<blockquote>
	  In any natural history of the human species, language would
	stand out as the preeminent trait.  <br/ >
	  <strong>p. 2</strong>
      </blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  Language is not a cultural artifact that we learn the way we
	learn to tell time [...]. Instead, it is a distinct piece of
	the biological makeup of our brains.<br/ >
	  <strong>p. 4</strong>
      </blockquote>


	<blockquote>
	  some cognitive scientists have described language as a
	psychological faculty, a mental organ, a neural system, and a
	computational module. I prefer the admittedly quaint term
	"instinct."<br/ >
	  <strong>p. 5</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  "[...] look at language not as the ineffable essence of
	human uniqueness but as a biological adaptation to
	communicate information" <br/ >
	  <strong>p. 5</strong>
      </blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  in 1871 [...] Darwin concluded that language ability is "an
	instinctive tendency to acquire an art" [...] he argued that we
	have all the instincts that animals do, and many more besides;
	our flexible intelligence comes from the interplay of many
	instincts competing. <br/ >
	  <strong>pp. 6-7</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  In this century, the most famous argument that language is
	like an instinct comes from Noam Chomsky [who] called
	attention to two fundamental facts about language. First,
	virtually every sentence that a person utters or understands
	is a brand new combination of words, appearing for the first
	time in the history of the world. [...] the brain must contain
	a recipe program that can build an unlimited set of sentences
	out of a finite set of words. [...] The second fundamental
	fact is that [...] children must innately be equipped with a
	plan common to the grammars of all languages, a Universal
	Grammar, that tells them how to distill the syntactic patterns
	out of the speech of their parents.<br/ >
	  <strong>pp. 8-9</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  Chomsky attacks what is still one of the foundations of
	twentieth-century intellectual life&mdash;the "Standard Social
	Science Model," according to which the human psyche is molded by
	the surrounding culture.<br/ >
	  <strong>p. 11</strong>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>
	The best place to begin is to ask why anyone should believe
	that human language is a part of human biology&mdash;an
	instinct&mdash;at all.  <br/ >
	  <strong>p. 11 (last sentence)</strong>
