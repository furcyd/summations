	<blockquote>
	  Language is beginning to submit to that uniquely satisfying
	  kind of understanding that we call science, but the news has
	  been kept a secret.<br/ >

	<blockquote>
	  I hope to convey the grand intellectual excitement that
	  launched the modern study of language several decades
	  ago. <br/ >

	<blockquote>
	  I can write in only one way, with a passion for powerful,

	<h4>Chapter 1 - An Instinct to Acquire an Art</h4>
	<hr />
	
	<blockquote>
	  In any natural history of the human species, language would
	stand out as the preeminent trait.  <br/ >
	  <strong>p. 2</strong>
      </blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  Language is not a cultural artifact that we learn the way we
	learn to tell time [...]. Instead, it is a distinct piece of
	the biological makeup of our brains.<br/ >
	  <strong>p. 4</strong>
      </blockquote>


	<blockquote>
	  some cognitive scientists have described language as a
	psychological faculty, a mental organ, a neural system, and a
	computational module. I prefer the admittedly quaint term
	"instinct."<br/ >
	  <strong>p. 5</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  "[...] look at language not as the ineffable essence of
	human uniqueness but as a biological adaptation to
	communicate information" <br/ >
	  <strong>p. 5</strong>
      </blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  in 1871 [...] Darwin concluded that language ability is "an
	instinctive tendency to acquire an art" [...] he argued that we
	have all the instincts that animals do, and many more besides;
	our flexible intelligence comes from the interplay of many
	instincts competing. <br/ >
	  <strong>pp. 6-7</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  In this century, the most famous argument that language is
	like an instinct comes from Noam Chomsky [who] called
	attention to two fundamental facts about language. First,
	virtually every sentence that a person utters or understands
	is a brand new combination of words, appearing for the first
	time in the history of the world. [...] the brain must contain
	a recipe program that can build an unlimited set of sentences
	out of a finite set of words. [...] The second fundamental
	fact is that [...] children must innately be equipped with a
	plan common to the grammars of all languages, a Universal
	Grammar, that tells them how to distill the syntactic patterns
	out of the speech of their parents.<br/ >
	  <strong>pp. 8-9</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  Chomsky attacks what is still one of the foundations of
	twentieth-century intellectual life&mdash;the "Standard Social
	Science Model," according to which the human psyche is molded by
	the surrounding culture.<br/ >
	  <strong>p. 11</strong>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>
	The best place to begin is to ask why anyone should believe
	that human language is a part of human biology&mdash;an
	instinct&mdash;at all.  <br/ >
	  <strong>p. 11 (last sentence)</strong>

	<h4>Chapter 2 - Chatterboxes</h4>
	<hr />

	<blockquote>
	  No mute tribe has ever been discovered, and there is no
	  record that a region has served as a "cradle" of language
	  from which it spread to previously languageless
	  groups. <br/ >
	    <strong>p. 13</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  The universality of complex language is a discovery that
          fills linguists with awe, and is the first reason to suspect
          that language is not just any cultural invention but the
          product of a special human instinct. Cultural inventions
          vary widely in their sophistication from society to society;
          within a society, the inventions are generally at the same
          level of sophistication. [...] Language, however, ruins this
          correlation.  There are Stone Age societies, but there is no
          such thing as a Stone Age language.
          <br/ >
	    <strong>p. 14</strong>
	</blockquote>
		
	<blockquote>
	  Actually, the people whose linguistic abilities are most
          badly underestimated are right here in our
          society. Linguists repeatedly run up against the myth that
          working-class people and the less educated members of the
          middle class speak a simpler or coarser language. This is a
          pernicious illusion arising from the effortlessness of
          conversation.
	  <br/ >
	    <strong>p. 15</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  The ubiquity of complex language among human beings is a
          gripping discovery and, for many observers, compelling proof
          that language is innate. But to tough-minded skeptics like
          the philosopher Hilary Putnam, it is no proof at all. Not
          everything that is universal is innate. [...] All languages
          have words for "water" and "foot" because all people need to
          refer to water and feet; [...] Once invented, language would
          entrench itself within a culture as parents taught their
          children and children imitated their parents. From cultures
          that had language, it would spread like wildfire to other,
          quieter cultures.
	  <br/ >
	    <strong>pp. 19-20</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
	  To convince you that there is a language instinct, I will
	  have to fill in an argument that leads from the jabbering of
	  modern peoples to the putative genes for grammar. [...]  The
	  crux of the argument is that complex language is universal
	  because <strong>children actually reinvent it</strong>,
	  generation after generation [...] because they just can't
	  help it.  <br/ >
	    <strong>p. 20</strong>
	</blockquote>

      	<blockquote>
	  The trail begins with the study of how the particular
          languages we find in the world today arose. [...] we need to
          see how people create a complex language from
          scratch. Amazingly, we can. The first cases were wrung from
          [...] the Atlantic slave trade [...] When speakers of
          different languages have to communicate to carry out
          practical tasks but do not have the opportunity to learn one
          another’s languages, they develop a makeshift jargon called
          a pidgin. [...] the linguist Derek Bickerton has presented
          evidence that in many cases a pidgin can be transmuted into
          a full complex language in one fell swoop: all it takes is
          for a group of children to be exposed to the pidgin at the
          age when they acquire their mother tongue. [...] The
          language that results when children make a pidgin their
          native tongue is called a creole. [...] Bickerton notes that
          if the grammar of a creole is largely the product of the
          minds of children, unadulterated by complex language input
          from their parents, it should provide a particularly clear
          window on the innate grammatical machinery of the brain.<br />
	  <strong>pp. 22-23</strong>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
          Bickerton’s particular claims are controversial, [...]  But
          his basic idea has been stunningly corroborated by two
          recent natural experiments in which creolization by children
          can be observed in real time [...] from the study of the
          sign languages of the deaf.  [...]  If we are to attribute
          the richness of language to the mind of the child, we really
          want to see a single child adding some increment of
          grammatical complexity to the input the child has
          received. [...] deaf children who are not born to deaf
          parents [...] often have no access to sign language users as
          they grow up [...] Their proficiency is notably below that
          of deaf people who acquired sign language as infants [...]
          because the deaf are virtually the only neurologically
          normal people who make it to adulthood without having
          acquired a language, their difficulties offer particularly
          good evidence that successful language acquisition must take
          place during a critical window of opportunity in
          childhood. [...] a nine-year-old profoundly deaf boy, to
          whom they gave the pseudonym Simon, and his parents, who are
          also deaf. Simon’s parents did not acquire sign language
          until the late ages of fifteen and sixteen, and as a result
          they acquired it badly. [...] Astoundingly, though Simon saw
          no ASL but his parents' defective version, his own signing
          was far better ASL than theirs. [...] Simon’s superiority to
          his parents is an example of creolization by a single living
          child.<br />
